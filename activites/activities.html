    <h1>Our Activities</h1>
    <p>
      Besides the hotels, our travel agency offers some programmes, which has
      been designed by us based on our previous experiences and feedbacks of our
      tourists. We provide enjoyable activities to every member of the family,
      including small children and young adoults who want to experience the
      cultural side of Egypt as well. Do not stress about creating the
      programmes by yourself, we have already done it for you. Just pick the
      packages you like and enjoy the experience the fullest.
